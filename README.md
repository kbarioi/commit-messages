# Commit Messages

We all have a notepad filled with commands that we copy/paste over and over again.

Commit messages lets you do this but more. Write fetch calls to get data and use in your strings, messages and commands.

Write custom logic to tweak the output to your desire.

## Get started

open the code and run `npm run dev` in the root dir of the project.

open `localhost:3200` and see an unscaffolded app.

If you have no interest in figuring this app out on your own:

1. in the code, navigate to the `defaults` folder
2. copy/paste the `fetch.ts` into the `fetch code` accordion in the UI
3. click `add block` in the UI and copy/paste the code from one of the other `.ts` files in the defaults folder into the code section of this new block
4. open the dev tools and see the console of the code you ran in the fetch code section and see that it doesn't work.
5. add secrets to the secrets accordion and make it work.
6. see your amazing commands brought to life

## Add a check

in the top of your blocks there is an input. You can add a boolean to your block code to toggle between states.
